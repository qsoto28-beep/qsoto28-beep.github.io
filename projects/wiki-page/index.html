        <h1> Crown shyness </h1>

        <P> <b>Crown shyness </b> (<i>also canopy disengagement,[1] canopy 
            shyness,[2] 
            or inter-crown spacing[3]</i>) is a phenomenon observed in some 
            tree species, in which the crowns of fully stocked trees do not 
            touch
            each other, forming a canopy with channel-like gaps.[41[5] The 
            phenomenon is most prevalent among trees of the same species,
            but also occurs between trees of different species.[617] 
            There exist many  hypotheses as to why crown shyness is an 
            adaptive behavior, and research suggests that it might inhibit 
            spread of leaf-eating insect larvae.[8]

            The exact physiological basis of crown shyness is not certain.[6] 
            The phenomenon has been discussed in scientific literature since the
            1920s.[9] The variety of hypotheses and experimental results might
            suggest that there are multiple mechanisms across different 
            species, an example of convergent evolution. [citation needed]

            Some hypotheses contend that the interdigitation of canopy branches
            leads to "reciprocal pruning" of adjacent trees. Trees in windy
            areas suffer physical damage as they collide with each other 
            during winds. As the result of abrasions and collisions, there is
            an induced crown shyness response. Studies suggest that lateral 
            branch growth is largely uninfluenced by neighbours until disturbed 
            by mechanical abrasion.[10] If the crowns are artificially prevented 
            from colliding in the winds, they gradually fill the canopy gaps.
            [11] This explains instances of crown shyness between branches of 
            the same organism. Proponents of this idea cite that shyness is 
            particularly seen in conditions conducive to this pruning, including 
            windy forests, stands of flexible trees, and early succession 
            forests where branches are flexible and limited in lateral movement.
            [6][12] By this explanation, variable flexibility in lateral 
            branches has a large bearing on degree of crown shyness.
