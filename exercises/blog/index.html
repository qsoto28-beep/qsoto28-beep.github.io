                Pokémon Legends: Arceus[a] is a 2022 action role-playing 
                game 
                developed by Game Freak and published by Nintendo and 
                The Pokémon Company for the Nintendo Switch. <br> <br>
                It is part of the 
                eighth generation of the Pokémon video game series and 
                serves 
                as a prequel to the fourth-generation titles Pokémon Diamond 
                and Pearl (2006). <br> <br>
                The game was first announced as part of the
                Pokémon 25th Anniversary event in February 2021, and was 
                released worldwide on 28 January 2022.

                Pokémon Legends: Arceus is an action role-playing game that 
                maintains the core gameplay of past mainline entries. <br> 
                <br>
                The player can freely explore the game map, which is divided 
                into five large areas of individual biomes. <br> <br>
                Each time the player 
                enters an area, they spawn in a camp and can fast travel to 
                other camps in the same area. Outside of traversing the 
                landscape on foot, the player can unlock rideable Pokémon 
                which 
                can travel faster, swim across bodies of water, climb 
                cliffs, or 
                fly.

                Unlike in previous titles, the player character can be 
                attacked 
                and harmed by wild Pokémon. If enough damage is taken, 
                they will 
                fall unconscious and reappear at the base camp. Players can 
                capture wild Pokémon in the overworld without engaging in 
                battle, though some must be battled before being caught. 
                <br> <br>
                Battles 
                can be initiated by releasing captured Pokémon near a wild 
                Pokémon. While the game retains the turn-based battle system 
                of 
                prior titles, Legends: Arceus allows players to trade attack 
                damage for more turns and vice versa.
